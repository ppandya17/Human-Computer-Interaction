The presentation we gave in class is created in Microsoft SWAY. The only disadvantage of the SWAY is that it cannot be downloaded. But it is available publically on internet.
So here is the link of our SWAY presentation: https://sway.com/nFOASTN7CGMUl84a
Our code is also available on GitHub.
GitHub link of our code: https://github.com/ppandya17/Human-Computer-Interaction
We also have published our GitHub code and it is nicely working on as Web Application.
Link of published GitHub Website: https://kinny94.github.io/Human-Computer-Interaction/
We have created our questionnaire form on Google Docs.
